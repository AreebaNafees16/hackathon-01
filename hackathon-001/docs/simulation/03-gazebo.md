# Chapter 3: Introduction to Gazebo

Gazebo is a powerful 3D robotics simulator that allows developers to test and validate robot algorithms in a virtual environment before deploying them on physical hardware.  
It integrates seamlessly with ROS 2, providing realistic physics, sensors, and visualization.

## 3.1 What is Gazebo?

Gazebo provides:

- **3D Physics Simulation**: Accurate modeling of gravity, collisions, and dynamics.  
- **Sensor Simulation**: Cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and GPS for realistic perception.  
- **Robot Models**: Supports URDF, SDF, and custom robot descriptions.  
- **Integration with ROS 2**: Full support for ROS topics, services, and actions.

Gazebo allows robotics developers to safely test complex behaviors without risking hardware damage.

## 3.2 Gazebo Architecture

1. **Worlds**: Virtual environments that contain models, lights, and terrain.  
2. **Models**: Robots, obstacles, and objects represented in URDF/SDF format.  
3. **Plugins**: Custom code that controls robot behavior or simulates sensors.  
4. **Transport**: Messaging system for communication between Gazebo and ROS 2 nodes.

## 3.3 Setting up Gazebo with ROS 2

1. **Install ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

# Verify installation
gazebo

#Integrate ROS 2
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 launch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch.py

# Example: Spawning a TurtleBot in Gazebo

# Create a ROS 2 workspace
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

# Clone TurtleBot3 packages
git clone -b humble-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git src/turtlebot3
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

# Launch TurtleBot3 in Gazebo
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
