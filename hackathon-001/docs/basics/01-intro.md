## 1.1 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems and robotics.  
It focuses on designing autonomous machines that can perceive, decide, and act in the real world.  
Key aspects include:

- **Sensors & Perception**: Understanding the environment via cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, etc.  
- **Actuators & Control**: Movement and interaction with objects using motors and joints.  
- **Intelligent Algorithms**: Planning, decision-making, and learning in real-time environments.

## 1.2 What are Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are machines designed to resemble human body structure and behavior.  
They often include:

- Head, torso, arms, and legs  
- Sensors for vision, touch, and balance  
- Software to enable walking, grasping, and interaction

Humanoids are used in research, healthcare, education, and assistive robotics.

## 1.3 Applications of Physical AI & Humanoids

1. **Healthcare**: Assistive robots for elderly or disabled individuals.  
2. **Research**: Testing AI algorithms in human-like robots.  
3. **Industrial Automation**: Robots performing tasks alongside humans safely.  
4. **Education & Entertainment**: Interactive robots for learning and engagement.  
5. **Autonomous Exploration**: Robots navigating complex environments.

## 1.4 Course Scope

This textbook will cover:

- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**: Middleware for robotic software integration.  
- **Simulation Environments**: Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac for testing robots.  
- **Navigation & VSLAM**: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.  
- **Humanoid Robot Workflow**: End-to-end design, simulation, and deployment.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Build basic robotic systems using ROS 2  
- Simulate humanoid robots in virtual environments  
- Implement navigation and perception pipelines  
- Develop small-scale humanoid workflows from design to testing

## 1.5 Example ROS 2 Python Node

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_node')
        self.get_logger().info("Hello, Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics!")

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = MinimalNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
